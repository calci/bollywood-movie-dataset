# bollywood-movie-dataset
Basic moviedata like actor names, genre, director names, sequel, date of release, etc of bollywood movies released between 2001 and 2014 

# Inspiration
Can we save the time and money wasted by movie viewers on viewing flop and disaster movies? Can we suggest must-watch movies to movie viewers even before movies release? Can we classify upcoming movies into 1 of 9 categories even before their release?

# Context
Indian Hindi Cinema, popularly known as Bollywood has witnessed exponential growth in terms of volume of business, manpower employed, number of movies produced each year and also the global reach. Hence, it could be of great commercial importance to develop a model which could predict the success of a movie before it's release. However, it is not easy to forecast demand for a movie. There are a number of factors like Actors, Directors, Time of Release, Genre, Production house etc. which affect the outcome of a movie.

The primary requirement to develop such a model would be the availability of Bollywood movie data. Thus, I created this dataset while working on my senior year research project, titled 'Predicting success of upcoming Bollywood movies'.

# Content
The data has been created manually by visiting different websites. The primary ones being Wikipedia, boxofficeindia.com and IMDB. The data contains 1285 rows with movies released between the years 2001 to 2014. The hitFlop column contains values from 1 to 9 with 

1 - Disaster 
2 - Flop 
3 - Below Average 
4 - Average 
5 - Semi Hit 
6 - Hit 
7 - Super Hit 
8 - Blockbuster 
9 - All-Time Blockbuster
